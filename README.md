# ball-clock
The ball clock is a simple device which keeps track of the passing minutes by moving ball-bearings through a series of rails and queues. Each minute, a rotating arm removes a ball bearing from the queue at the bottom, raises it to the top of the clock and deposits it on a track leading to indicators displaying minutes, five-minutes and hours. These indicators display the time between 1:00 and 12:59, but without 'a.m.' or 'p.m.' indicators. Thus 2 balls in the minute indicator, 6 balls in the five-minute indicator and 5 balls in the hour indicator displays the time 5:32.
